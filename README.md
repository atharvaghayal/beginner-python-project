# 🛡️ Basic Python Cryptography Toolkit

This is a **100% Python-based project** that implements several classic cryptographic techniques and tools:

- 🔐 Hash Cracker
- 🔁 Caesar Cipher (Encrypt/Decrypt)
- 🔁 Substitution Cipher
- 🔁 Transposition Cipher

> 🎯 Built as a beginner-level project to understand the foundations of **encryption, decryption, and brute-force cracking**.

## 🧩 Features

### 1. 🔓 Hash Cracker
- Cracks simple hashed passwords using a dictionary attack.
- Supports hashing algorithms like MD5, SHA-1, etc.
- Useful to demonstrate password vulnerability to weak hashing.

### 2. 🧠 Caesar Cipher
- Implements classic Caesar shift cipher.
- Supports both encryption and decryption.
- User-defined shift value.

### 3. 🔁 Substitution Cipher
- Substitutes characters based on a static or custom mapping.
- User can define substitution rules or use default.

### 4. 🔁 Transposition Cipher
- Rearranges the letters of the message using key-based columnar transposition.
- Encrypts and decrypts text using the pattern.
